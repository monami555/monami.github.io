# About

This is my learning blog project, where I am uploading summaries of great books which I read and the courses I attended on the topic of Software Development. 

# Project implementation

The project uses Github Pages and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

## Post Comments

There is an interesting solution for [comments hosted on GitHub by Ivan Zuzak](http://ivanzuzak.info/2011/02/18/github-hosted-comments-for-github-hosted-blogs.html) that I added here.

## Tag Cloud

I have used the [Tag Cloud by Tobias Sj√∂sten](http://vvv.tobiassjosten.net/jekyll/jekyll-tag-cloud/).

## Table of Contents

I have used a generated Table of Contents as described [here](http://www.seanbuscay.com/blog/jekyll-toc-markdown).

## Post Search

Is done in Jekyll using lunr.js, see instructions [here](http://jekyll.tips/jekyll-casts/jekyll-search-using-lunr-js/).
